# Register-Allocation
Compilers play a vital role in the world of computer science, responsible not only for generating code but also for ensuring efficient and effective allocation of registers. The problem of register allocation can be complex, resembling the coloring problem which is known to be NP complete. In this assignment, we use Kempe's heuristic and tools such as JTB and the visitor pattern to come up with a nearly optimal register allocation for a given piece of Java code. Through this process, we gain a deeper understanding of the inner workings of compilers and the art of efficient code generation.
